        <h2><span>Why</span> Ride With Us?</h2>
        <p>
            South Wales MTB is for everyone. No elitism, no pressure. We just want to ride bikes with people that want to ride bikes. We welcome all levels of ability, all ages and all bikes (Yes, even you e-bikers). We meet regularly, at least once a week and ride different spots as much as possible so you'll always find a ride that suits you. Hit the <strong>join us!</strong> button to find out when and where we're riding next. Membership is <strong>free</strong> and it always will be.

                    Friends. The more the merrier. Connecting with like minded people and sharing some stoke, blowing off some steam, hitting that jump or drop that's just too intimidating to hit by yourself or just for the chinwag. In this club, you'll meet all sorts. Not just our members but our connections with shops etc. It's not what you know, it's who.

                    Every ride is an opportunity to pick up some knowledge. Our club is made up of a huge range of riders and some of our members are even professional MTB coaches. As a member you can enjoy access to private and group coaching sessions at a discounted rate from a variety of local coaches.

                    Easily one of the favourites of members is the travel. We aim to get in at least one summer and one winter trip each year and have visited Morzine, Madeira, Whistler and New Zealand in previous years.

                    Variety is the spice of life, right? Thanks to our members we are always finding new trails and locations to ride. Trail builders are a secretive bunch so having them in the club gives us inside knowledge on the freshest tracks in the valleys. On top of that, we have also worked closely with local councils to establish sanctioned dig sites where we can build tracks without having to worry that they will be destroyed.
