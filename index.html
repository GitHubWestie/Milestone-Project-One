        <h2>Why Ride With Us?</h2>
        <p>
            We are the biggest and best MTB club in South Wales. We meet regularly, usually once a week, and ride for fun, keeping it fresh by riding different spots as much as possible. We're long established too, so have a great relationship with the trail faeries, bike parks, shops and other businesses. Some will even offer a discount for goods or services when presenting a valid membership card.

                        Variety is the spice of life, right? Thanks to our members we are always finding new trails and locations to ride. Trail builders are a secretive bunch so having them in the club gives us inside knowledge on the freshest tracks in the valleys. On top of that, we have also worked closely with local councils to establish sanctioned dig sites where we can build tracks without having to worry that they will be destroyed.
